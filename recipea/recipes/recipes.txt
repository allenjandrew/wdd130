Crockpot Yogurt

★★★★★

Prep Time: 2 min, 3 hr, 2 hr. | Cook Time: 8 - 12 hrs | Makes: 20 | Difficulty: Easy

Ingredients:

• 1+ gallon milk
• 1/2 - 3/4 cup (plain) yogurt "culture" (make sure yogurt has the live bacteria in it - usually printed on the side of the cup)
• -------------
• Use 2-3 tbsp yogurt (starter) per 1 qt milk

Directions:

1. Heat milk in crockpot on High to 180° (175°-180°). It'll take 2 3/4 - 3 hrs. (Instant Pot: fill milk until "max" line. Press "Yogurt", then press "adjust", until machine reads "boil". It will take ~1 hr. 15 min. to get to 180°)

2. Turn off heat/unplug, remove pot from crock shell; cool to 115° (110°-120°). It'll take abt. 1 1/2 hrs.? (Instant Pot: remove pot at end of boil cycle and allow to cool on trivet ~2 1/2-3 hr.)

3. Remove abt. 2 c. milk and stir culture/starter* into that (*2-3 tbsp yogurt / 1 qt milk).

4. Add starter mixture back to main milk pot and stir gently. Check temperature. Incubate between 90°-110° (100° for best thickness).

5. With heat off/unplugged, cover and incubate 8-12 hrs (longer is fine, too). (Cover crock with a large towel/small blanket).

Minimum Fermenting/Incubating times:

(If using...)

whole milk = 7-8 hrs.

2% milk = 9 hrs.

skim milk = up to 10 hrs.

The liquid that separates from the yogurt is the whey and is very nutritious. Use it to make breads or in other foods. If nothing else, to feed to animals or water your plants with.

6. If desired, strain (20-30 min.) using nut bag or a colander lined with cheese cloth to thicken the yogurt and (in the bowl beneath) collect the whey.

Reserve a small portion of yogurt to be your starter for next time. It is OK to freeze this (I do so it doesn't accidentally get eaten.)

7. Add sweetener (ie. honey, maple, vanilla, etc.) to taste (opt.) and store yogurt in (individual) containers in the fridge and enjoy at leisure.

Notes:

Straining will help to remove lactose. Also, to remove lactose: bring initial temp. to 200°, keep warm for 10 min. then cool to 115°, add culture, incubate at 120° for 1hr. then lower to 86° and incubate for 18 more hours (take out some yogurt to be the starter for the next batch of yogurt after about 3 hrs.). This is when the acidity will stop increasing, indicating that all the available lactose has been consumed by the culture. [brodandtaylor.com/lactose-free-yogurt-recipe/] Longer culture/incubating times = more tang/sourness.
