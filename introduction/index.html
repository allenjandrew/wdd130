    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hey all, I'm Andrew Allen from Minneapolis, Minnesota. I'm a junior and a
      financial economics major (with a minor in computer science).

      I love winter and everything about snow - I would spend all my free time
      skiing and snowboarding if I only had the money for it. Over winter break
      I helped my dad build two igloos, a luge track, and an ice rink in our
      backyard.

      I'm taking this class for my minor and because my roommate is also in the
      same class. We're both pretty new to web development, I'd say I'm at a 2
      or 3. But I'm looking forward to this class and improving my programming
      skills! I think it's super important to get a good knowledge of
      programming, computer science, and web development. If nothing else, these
      are fields that I can always fall back on.
    </p>

      I've been a member of the Church all my life. One of my favorite
      scriptures is Helaman 5:12 - "Remember that it is upon the rock of our
      Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your
      foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea,
      his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm
      shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to
      the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are
      built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they
      cannot fall."
