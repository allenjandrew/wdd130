            Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow?

            Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages. We have
            found however that children over the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more
            overall (and parents especially enjoy it more if their children are
            all over 8).
          </p>
          <p>
            A common concern we get from parents is that their children will be
            bored stuck on a boat for hours at a time. Surprisingly we deal with
            very few bored children of any age. The areas we are rafting through
            are some of the most beautiful in the world, and you never know what
            you might see around any corner. Not to mention the rapids which
            keep things very interesting! Each boat also comes equipped with a
            guide. It has been proven that river guides are unable to go for
            very long at all without telling stories ... some of which are even
            true!

            Is whitewater rafting safe? I don't even know how to swim! Can I

            As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed
            element of risk. To help ensure your safety, our guides are all
            certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with at least 3
            years of rafting experience. The most common injuries are sunburns
            and injuries that occur on land.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everyone on commercial rafting trips wears coast guard approved life
            vest or personal flotation device (PFD). Many non swimmers go on
            rafting trips and have a great time. Your guide will give you an in
            depth and engaging safety talk before your trip begins explaining
            what you should prepare for and do in the event that you fall out of
            the raft.

            We will provide all necessary camping equipment. This includes a

            The most effective way to plan for temperature and weather changes
            in the Canyon is to be prepared for both hot & dry and cold & wet
            environments.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Rain jacket and rain pants - do not bring ponchos</li>
            <li>
              Quick dry shirts and shorts, long sleeve cotton shirt and pants -
              helps keep you cooler on hot days. Button down shirts provide more
              sun protection on the neck
            </li>
            <li>
              Light Weight Cotton Pant, Nylon Pant or Sarong -
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The best thing for men to wear are swim trunks as shorts. If
                  you are cold natured, bring polypropylene long underwear top
                  and bottom
                </li>
                <li>
                  Women wear swim suits or quick dry underwear and sport bras as
                  a base layer during the day. Over the base layer, wear a pair
                  of quick dry shorts and the shirt of your choice
                  (polypropylene if you are cold, cotton if you are hot). Two
                  piece swim suits are convenient when changing or going to the
                  bathroom.

          <h2>What is so great about whitewater rafting anyway?</h2>
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            Are you kidding me! What's not great about whitewater rafting! Let's
            describe a common day on the river.
          </p>
          <p>
            Arise in the soft light of the early morning after a night spent
            sleeping under a beautiful starry sky. Have a hearty warm breakfast
            of fresh blueberry pancakes or omelets to order, then pack your
            things and prepare for the day. The day is filled with some
            combination of swift water, rapids, calms, hikes, history, geology,
            stories, and more good food. We try to hit camp around 4 or 5, after
            setting up your cot you can relax with a good book or good company
            by the river, or explore around camp while your guides prepare your
            dinner...something perhaps like steak and potatoes, or grilled
            salmon...and dutch oven brownies...you won't forget the dutch oven
            brownies. After dinner it's more relaxing, and you might even be
            able to talk your guide into another story or two to send you off to
            bed under more stars than you thought were possible.

          <h2>How far in advance should I book my trip?</h2>
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            If you have specific dates you need, we recommend booking a year in
            advance. If you can be more flexible 6 months in advance is usually
            sufficient.
