          <p>
            Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the
            Salmon river. The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the
            <b>River of No Return</b> by the people living near it because of
            the number of folks that came to visit and
            <b>fell so in love</b> with the rugged beauty of the river that they
            never left.
          </p>
          <p>
            Herds of <b>elk</b> and <b>deer</b> graze on the hillsides around
            the river and <b>bear</b> and <b>bighorn sheep</b> are also commonly
            sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring
            <b>ponderosa pine</b> which tower over the sandy beaches in the
            campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's not forget the rapids! They range from <b>class I-IV</b>. The
            Salmon is one of the longest undammed rivers in the United States.
            As a free flowing river the water is
            <b>higher, faster, and colder</b> in the early summer and
            <b>lower, slower, and warmer</b> in the late summer. There are good
            rapids all summer...but families with children who like to swim tend
            to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.

          <p>
            Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the
            <b>most desolate</b> land anywhere, the Green river flows towards
            the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs,
            beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run
            famous. This <b>84-mile trip</b> runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys
            Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding
            <b>scenery</b>, interesting <b>geologic formations</b>, evidence of
            <b>prehistoric and historic</b> human activity, and great whitewater
            opportunities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Desolation is rated a <b>Class II/III</b> and is usually done in 6
            days.
          </p>
          <p>
            Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a <b>National Landmark</b>.
            This designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that
            the canyon tells.

          <p>
            This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all
            river trips. You will <b>never forget</b> your visit to the Grand
            Canyon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Grand Canyon river rafting combines
            <b>world-class whitewater</b> with <b>breathtaking scenery</b> to
            make one truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled
            not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, but with side canyons
            and <b>ancient indian ruins</b>
            accessible only by river.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>CLASS I - X</b>: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating
            scale. The rapids in the Canyon are technically rated I - X ( 1 -
            10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river
            variances. However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V
            river rating scale, so we often refer to both.
