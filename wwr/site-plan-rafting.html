      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        We've stayed away from the nets for too long. This website is to
        establish our company's presence online. The site will provide
        information about our company and things such as the river's history,
        rafting safety, and things to do nearby. The site will also provide a
        platform for clients to make rafting and gear reservations, pay, and
        leave reviews. The site will convey a feeling of rugged excitement
        tempered by homestyle comfort.
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        Our audience consists mainly of adults and young adults ages 20 to 40.
        Many of clients are experienced rafters, and just want a seamless,
        traditional experience. Many others are new or inexperienced rafters,
        who need to feel safe and informed. We also get many groups of Scouts
        and youth groups. We can expect this site to be accessed primarily on
        desktop, but also on mobile.

You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
